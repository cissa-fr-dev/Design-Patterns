- In this application I made one input editable and two inputs disabled, these disabled inputs will take the input value while listening. If they're not listening, don't change your state:
<div align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60928500/152992672-f85f976d-b706-4b58-b94c-a83bedbc386a.gif" width="700"></div>

#### run this application
- run `npm install`
- run `npx tsc observer.ts -w` in terminal to generate a .js file
- use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to run in browser
